# Features
## Navigation Bar: The navigation bar at the top of the page includes links to various sections of the website, such as Home, Trending, Subscriptions, and more. These links are styled to match the original YouTube design.

## Search Bar: A search bar is located at the top of the page, allowing users to search for videos by entering keywords. The search bar is also styled to closely resemble the YouTube search bar.

## Video Thumbnails: The main content of the landing page is a grid of video thumbnails. Each thumbnail represents a video and includes the video's title, uploader's name, and view count. Hovering over a thumbnail reveals additional options like "Watch later" and "Add to queue".
