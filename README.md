<h2>🧐 Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Navigation Bar: The navigation bar at the top of the page includes links to various sections of the website such as Home Trending Subscriptions and more. These links are styled to match the original YouTube design.
*   Search Bar: A search bar is located at the top of the page allowing users to search for videos by entering keywords. The search bar is also styled to closely resemble the YouTube search bar.
*   Video Thumbnails: The main content of the landing page is a grid of video thumbnails. Each thumbnail represents a video and includes the video's title uploader's name and view count. Hovering over a thumbnail reveals additional options like "Search with your voice" and "Search".
